                <p>Sustanify Hub's commitment to sustainability extends beyond merely offering eco-friendly products; it encompasses a comprehensive approach that seeks to revolutionize supply chains. In this section, we introduce an innovative idea â€“ setting up subsidiaries in underdeveloped countries. We will also discuss the significant benefits of a franchise model for both sustainability and affordability.</p>

                <p style={{ marginBottom: "10px" }}>Localization: We select the top 50 eco-friendly products annually and produce them in underdeveloped countries, taking into account the specific needs and demands of those regions. This approach aligns with our commitment to sustainability, as it reduces the carbon footprint associated with international shipping.</p>

This approach aligns with our commitment to sustainability, as it reduces the carbon footprint associated with international shipping.</p>
                <p style={{ marginBottom: "10px" }}>Affordability: By producing these products locally, we can significantly reduce the cost, making them more affordable to a wider population, including those who could not previously access sustainable options.</p>
                <p style={{ marginBottom: "10px" }}>Royalty and Consultation Services: Companies that originally produce these products receive royalties for sales in other countries, incentivizing their participation in our global sustainability efforts. Our corporation charges a nominal transaction cost (0.1%) for consultation services, which also contributes to sustainability initiatives.</p>

              <div className={styles.slide_content_2}>
                <p style={{ marginBottom: "10px" }}>Local Empowerment: Subsidiaries are often employee-owned, ensuring that the local population is involved in decision-making and benefits from the business operations.</p>
                <p style={{ marginBottom: "10px" }}>Affordability: Producing eco-friendly products locally significantly reduces costs, making them more accessible to a broader demographic, including those in underdeveloped countries.</p>
                <p style={{ marginBottom: "10px" }}>Reduced Carbon Footprint: Local production reduces the environmental impact associated with long-distance shipping, contributing to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
                <p style={{ marginBottom: "10px" }}>Economic Development: Establishing subsidiaries creates job opportunities, fosters entrepreneurship, and stimulates economic development in underdeveloped regions.</p>
                <p style={{ marginBottom: "10px" }}>By employing a franchise model, Sustanify Hub not only furthers its commitment to sustainability but also extends the benefits of eco-friendly products to those who may have been excluded due to financial constraints. This innovative approach aligns with our vision of a world where sustainability is accessible to all, regardless of their geographical location or economic status.</p>

                <p style={{ marginBottom: "10px" }}>Transparency and Trust: Blockchain records every carbon credit transaction in a transparent and unchangeable ledger, providing a clear and indisputable record of emissions reductions. This transparency fosters trust among all parties involved, from businesses and individuals to project developers and verifiers.</p>
                <p style={{ marginBottom: "10px" }}>Accessibility: By utilizing blockchain, we can lower the barriers to entry in the carbon credit market. This means that even small businesses, individuals, and organizations with limited resources can participate in carbon offsetting initiatives, democratizing the fight against climate change.</p>
                <p style={{ marginBottom: "10px" }}>Reduced Transaction Costs: Blockchain technology eliminates intermediaries, reducing transaction costs associated with carbon credit trading.

                <p style={{ marginBottom: "10px" }}>Innovation and Collaboration: Blockchain-enabled carbon credits open the door to new levels of innovation and collaboration. Smart contracts can automate the process, ensuring that credits are only released when the agreed-upon emissions reductions are achieved. This guarantees the integrity of the credits and reduces the need for manual verification.</p>
